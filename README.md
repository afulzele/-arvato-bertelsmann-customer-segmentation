#### Libraries

Libraries needed to install so as to run the file are:
  * `Anaconda` is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing that aims to simplify package
  * `XGBoost` is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable.
  * `LGBM` is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.

#### Introduction

This project is one of the capstone projects provided by Udacity as a part of Data Science Nanodegree. The end goal of the project is to determine how the company would acquire new customers.

In this project, we are using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to analyze customer demographics in Germany and predict potential customers which will increase the efficiency of acquiring the customers.

#### Project Motivation

This project is one of the available capstone projects. I chose this project mainly for several:

  1. It is a real-world problem provided by Arvato Financial Solutions. The data is not properly transformed, making it a chance for an intensive experience with data processing.
  2. Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers together based on common characteristics. These customer groups are beneficial in marketing campaigns, in identifying potentially profitable customers, and in developing customer loyalty. It is one of the fields in data science and machine learning that is continuously growing and it would be worth to have a hands on experience in developing models to predict customers responses.
  
 #### Files
 
The dataset is provided by Arvato Financial Solutions which is proprietary. I chose not to upload the datasets but will write down in brief about the datasets along with other files.
  
  1. `Udacity AZDIAS 052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891,211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).
  2. `Udacity CUSTOMERS 052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 191,652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).
  3. `Udacity MAILOUT 052018 TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42,982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).
  4. `Udacity MAILOUT 052018 TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42,833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).
  5. `Diaz Attributes â€“ Value 2017.xlsx`: Information of each features and its values.
  6. `Arvato_Project_Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks used to do EDA and perform machine learning modelings.
  
#### Result

Identified clusters of relevant future customers and predicted positive responses from the customers to the mail-order campaign successfulyan extensive discussion.
